# Integration Layer for Robotics-Core1

This directory contains components that facilitate communication and interoperability between the different language layers of the robotics-core1 project.

## Components

1. **Rust-Python Bridge**: Enables calling Rust functions from Python and vice versa
2. **DSL Interpreter**: Executes DSL code within both Rust and Python environments
3. **Message Passing System**: Facilitates efficient communication between components

## Architecture

The integration layer follows these design principles:

1. **Minimal Overhead**: Performance-critical paths have minimal abstraction layers
2. **Type Safety**: Data conversions maintain type safety across language boundaries
3. **Error Handling**: Clear propagation of errors between language environments
4. **Memory Management**: Careful handling of memory ownership across language boundaries

## Usage

Integration components are used internally by the other layers and are not typically accessed directly by users of the robotics-core1 system.

## Implementation Status

- [x] Basic project structure
- [ ] Rust-Python FFI bindings
- [ ] DSL interpreter integration
- [ ] Message passing system
