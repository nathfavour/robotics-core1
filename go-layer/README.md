# Go Layer for Robotics-Core1

This directory contains the Go-based networking and communication backend for the robotics-core1 project, providing robust connectivity between system components and external services.

## Purpose

The Go layer serves as the communication backbone of the robotics-core1 system, with the following responsibilities:

1. **Component Interconnection**: Facilitates communication between the Rust core, Python layer, and DSL interpreter
2. **Remote Control**: Provides secure interfaces for remote monitoring and control
3. **Cloud Integration**: Manages data synchronization with cloud services
4. **Distributed Computing**: Enables coordinated operation across multiple devices
5. **Network Resilience**: Ensures reliable operation in environments with unreliable connectivity

## Architecture

The Go layer is built around a service-oriented architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Handles external requests and authentication
- **Message Broker**: Manages internal communication between components
- **State Synchronizer**: Maintains consistency across distributed instances
- **Protocol Adapters**: Support various communication protocols (MQTT, gRPC, WebSockets)
- **Cloud Connectors**: Interface with specific cloud platforms

## Features

- **High Throughput**: Efficiently handles high-volume sensor data and control messages
- **Low Latency**: Minimizes communication delays for real-time control
- **Fault Tolerance**: Gracefully handles network disruptions and component failures
- **Security**: Implements encryption, authentication, and authorization
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Scalability**: Scales from single robots to fleets

## Implementation

The implementation leverages Go's concurrency model and standard library features:

- Goroutines for concurrent message handling
- Channels for coordinated communication
- Context for request management and cancellation
- Built-in HTTP/2 support for efficient connections
- Standard crypto packages for security

## Usage

The Go layer starts automatically when the system boots and provides services to other components through well-defined interfaces described in the API documentation.

## Development

To work on the Go layer:

1. Ensure you have Go 1.18+ installed
2. Navigate to the go-layer directory
3. Run `go mod download` to fetch dependencies
4. Use `go run cmd/server/main.go` for development
5. Use `go build cmd/server/main.go` to build executables

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Or for more verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```
