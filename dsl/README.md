# Custom DSL for Robotics-Core1

This directory contains the implementation of a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed specifically for representing and manipulating AI algorithms within the robotics-core1 project.

## Design Philosophy

The DSL is designed to:

1. Express AI algorithms in a concise, readable format
2. Allow for safe self-modification by the AI system
3. Be easily generated and manipulated programmatically
4. Compile to efficient code that can be executed by the Rust core

## Language Structure

The DSL follows a declarative style with functional elements, making it suitable for representing data processing pipelines and transformation logic.

### Example Syntax

```
algorithm DetectObject {
  input: ImageData
  output: ObjectDetection
  
  pipeline {
    // Extract features from image
    features = extract_features(input)
    
    // Classify features
    classifications = classify(
      data: features,
      threshold: 0.75
    )
    
    // Return detection results
    return {
      objects: classifications.filter(confidence > 0.8),
      processing_time: timer.elapsed()
    }
  }
}

function extract_features(image: ImageData) -> FeatureMap {
  // Function implementation
  // ...
}
```

## Implementation

The DSL implementation consists of:

1. A parser written in Rust that converts DSL code to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
2. A compiler that transforms the AST into executable code
3. An interpreter for development and debugging
4. Python bindings to allow the Python layer to generate and manipulate DSL code

## Usage

DSL code can be:
1. Written manually for core algorithms
2. Generated by the Python meta-programming layer
3. Modified by the AI system as part of its self-improvement process

## Current Status

The DSL is in early development. The basic syntax and semantics are defined, but the implementation is ongoing.
